# Single-Cell RNA-Seq Standard Pipeline in R

This repository provides a comprehensive pipeline for processing and analyzing single-cell RNA-sequencing data using R. The workflow leverages several R packages—including Seurat, tidyverse, and DoubletFinder—to facilitate quality control, normalization, doublet detection, downstream analysis, and visualization. This pipeline is designed to be modular so that you can save intermediate results (e.g., normalized objects) and resume analysis without re-running the complete workflow.
